- User engament with the mobile app is the most challenging task for the designer. Because when theuser is going to oprate the functions, navigation or any thing than it seems very easy to operate even for non technical user. 
- Design should be very clean and minimal that attaract use to click a button, fill up the form, open data visualization, Interact with other screen. 
- We can divide the engagement in two parts
**1. Engaging content (information)**
**2. Engaging functionality (operation)**
### **Engaging Content**

- which one you loves? Secone one. right? phrase our text in a conversational style and not just throw facts at the screen.
- video
  - When you shows a video or GIf to the user people loves to see once. If they're not interested to use the product or whatever? 
  - Once they open open the video and check the product and if the love they use. So Actually it works. Many of the comapnies belive that video is the best way to express your thoughts into visuals.
