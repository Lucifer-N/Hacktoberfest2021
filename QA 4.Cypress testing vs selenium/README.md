# Cypress testing vs selenium
### Cypress Testing :
Cypress is a purely a javascript based frontend testing tool used for morden web.it can be useful for both developers and QAs, but it is more developer friendly tool because for web development mainly javascript is used and cypress is also a javascript based tool 
using cypress you can:
 - set up test
 - write a test 
 - execute test 
 - debug a test.

### Selenium :
Selenium is open source tool used for testing, it supports multiple browsers and multiple languages, you can use a language of your interest and with which your are comfortable and you can create a test scription. Selenium has a suite of software that contains:

 -Selenium Integrated Development Environment 
-Selenium Remote Control
-Selenium webdriver
-Selenium Grid 

Now  let's start the comparison of both tools, as we know both the tools are used for functional testing using web browser, but both have it's own diffirent features. Selenium is widely used for testing and cypress is recently  introduced tool.
### 1. Language Supported : 
Selenium supports multiple languages like Java,Python,C# ,Ruby,Php etc, but cypress supports only one language that is a  javascript, it can be a banifit for developer and disadvantage for some QAs who does not know the javascript.
### 2. Browser Support :
Selenium supports the multiiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox,Safari,Edge,IE and Opera.While cypress suports only Chrome,Firefox ,Edge and Electron,most peapole used chrome of Firefox so both the tools supports these two browsers but for more browser supports selenium will be a benificiary 
### 3 Framework support :
Cypress supports React,Vue,Angular,Elm etc javascript based frameworks,when selenium suppports Maven,JUnit,TestNG also Jenkins for CI/CD for automating the deployment process.
###4 Performance :
Performance wise selenium is slower then cypress because it creates  so many layers for runnig the code between the test  and browser.while cypress does not have many layred architectured.
###5 Network Traffic Control : 
selenium does not control network traffic flow while cypress no network lag as tests are executed within the browser, you csn control,stub and test edge test cases without any involvement of the server
