### Features

The facts of the last 18  months and so are the isolation of COVID19, the evolution of remote work and conferencing technology (Zoom, Microsoft team, etc.). They have shown us that our work does not stop but becomes more complex. some of the fundamental work that drives the design. Fuel to be with, talk and spend time with our users. 

The hard work of spending time among your users becomes more complicated with the risk of getting sick. However, as  more and more people get vaccinated, we need to get back to our users and spend time observing,  talking to them and  getting feedback from your users.

As a designer and more importantly as introvert my self I wanted to offer some activities, tips, and then some encouragement exercies I personally follow to do the hard work and hang out with the users.
