### Introduction

The facts of the last 18  months and so are the isolation of COVID19, the evolution of remote work and conferencing technology (Zoom, Microsoft team, etc.). They have shown us that our work does not stop but becomes more complex. some of the fundamental work that drives the design. Fuel to be with, talk and spend time with our users. 

The hard work of spending time among your users becomes more complicated with the risk of getting sick. However, as  more and more people get vaccinated, we need to get back to our users and spend time observing,  talking to them and  getting feedback from your users.

As a designer and more importantly as introvert my self I wanted to offer some activities, tips, and then some encouragement exercies I personally follow to do the hard work and hang out with the users.

 Few minutes observation session

# 1. Few minutes observation session

The skill of observation is something that designers have to practice all the time. If you claim to be doing human-centered design, you should make sure these ideas are put into practice by spending time with users from across your  team.

### Activity Instructions:

**1.**  Go  watch your users for at least 15-20 minutes. If you are working on a product that has a physical store, this means going and being a fly on the wall and seeing how your users spend time in the store. Especially how they use their technology in the store.

**2.** Record your observations with notes, photos, videos, and / or sound recordings.

**3.** Conclude your observations into 2 or 3 key insights.

If you are working on an a SaaS, these observing sessions can be more challenging  as you don't have a physical store to view your users.

However, as a designers we must employ technology that helps us quickly to look at screen capture. Some options may be ...

- Recording Tools
- Heat Maps
- Screen share observations

# 2. Follow a user through a process.

As a designer, your role is to solve your users' problems and for  that you need to step back and understand your user's mental model for that experience. The mental model and helps to answer the question "why". Why  your user should do "x" requires you to dig deeper than just understanding the steps required and the path  provided to complete a process. In short, watching your user complete a task is about refining and refining a solution.

### Activity Instructions:

**1.** Go and watch your users. (Same as Activity 1)

**2.** Watch a user complete an entire process.As a designer, you should have an idea of the tasks, the sequence the user should follow. Your observations should be connected to evaluating success or failure or any of the processes.

**3.** Document and time each process step  through timestamps, notes, photos, videos, and/or audio recordings.

**4.** Conclude your observations into 2 or 3 key insights.

**Tip**
- Using your smartphone + notebook, document the process. Record the time and record the start and end times of the process. 

-  When you observe a process, you don't want to influence your users. Find an inconspicuous place where you can sit or stand and use your phone to capture the users you observe. 

- Document pauses, repeated sections, and  other problems that the user may  encounter during the process.

# 3. Can I ask 1 question?

As a designer observation is useful but it's just a tiny piece of the puzzle. Like a detective following all the clues, a designer should follow up their observations with a good question to their user.

### Activity Instructions:

**1** After completing the observation session (Activity 1 or 2), interact with 1 person you are observing.

**2.** You ask ... "Excuse me, can I ask a question?" 

**3.** If your users answered "Yes" to your original question. Snap In Your Purpose 

*Script:*
- Thanks, am I  (research/design/product role) working to improve your process and have I noticed that you are doing it (observed activity)? Can you tell me how many times you have come here and done the `x`? 
- After the user answers. Thank them for their time. If you want more information or find them very useful, exchange emails/business cards and let them know that you want to talk to them more, but let them  go  their own way.

**4.** Document what your user said in their answer into 2 to 3 key takeaways.

# Conclusion

Remind everyone you work with, your clients, your colleagues, your boss, and your fellow designers. YOU ARE NOT A USER! So you need to step outside your design desk and spend time in the world with your users. Design is tough, but what makes it even harder is locking yourself in your Zoom office, home office, conference room, or meeting and hopefully we get it "right".

As a reminder, there is no "right"! there is only close. We implement solutions in the time, money and talent provided. If you spend more time understanding your users, more user validation, and more time allowing your "designers" to spend time with your users, you can get a very good solution. Plus, your users and  designers will benefit from it. Teams that are allowed to practice what they preach usually come up with better, faster, and more meaningful solutions for users and have  fun along the way. Don't forget the fun!

Support the ability to spend time with your users every step of the way because the fun in design is seeing your users succeed.
